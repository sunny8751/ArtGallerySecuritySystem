# Art Gallery Security System

A 3D simulation of a museum of paintings with a security system comprised of two cameras. The goal of the simulation is to determine the best placement of cameras such that the **risk of theft is minimized**. 

There were **seven different room configurations** of paintings that were tested.

The green paintings symbolize that the camera can see that entire painting, while the red paintings aren't yet seen by the camera.

This program was created for my Mathematical Modeling class project. The final paper can be found [here](Art_Gallery_Security_System_Paper.pdf).
